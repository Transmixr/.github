# Transmixr github organization

This GitHub organization is maintained by the Transmixr EU project, https://transmixr.eu.

As of this writing (February 2023) there are no useful public repositories yet. There are private repositories containing the development work done in the project.

## Becoming a member

If you are part of the Transmixr team: ask Conor or Jack to give you access. This is best done with a message to the `WP3` Slack channel. Don't forget to mention your github user name.
